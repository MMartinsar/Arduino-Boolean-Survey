# Arduino-Boolean-Survey

This project made with Arduino and coded in C++, is a "yes" and "no" survey having two buttons being this two options (the ones at the right) and one last button (the one at the left) that gives you the final result and resets the ROM memory as every data is stored there. Of the two option buttons, the rightmost one is the "yes" and the left one, the one in the middle if we include all three buttons, is the "no" option.

## Materials

- Arduino Uno R3
- Protoboard
- 2 x 10 kΩ resistors
- 1 kΩ resistor
- 3 x buttons
